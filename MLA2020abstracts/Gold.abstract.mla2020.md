### Abstract

## The Syllabus as Shared Negotiation

We share syllabi in multiple contexts: faculty are often required to share their syllabi with their departments; departments sometimes share a syllabus with faculty for a required course. But there are other kinds of sharing: increasingly, faculty share their syllabi with the world through social media, blog posts, and deposits to institutional repositories. They share syllabi in draft form, to receive feedback. Sometimes they share partially formed syllabi with their students, with the expectation that students will co-create the syllabus with them. 

Across all of these forms of sharing is an act of negotiation: the syllabus becomes a site of expectation-setting but also pushback. Rarely does a syllabus stay the same; rather, it changes over time, over the course of the semester, as students as for increased clarity on assignments and readings. The syllabus, as a site of negotiation, is therefore also a site where power is negotiated, where the intellectual and practical requirements of the course are shaped and reshaped.
