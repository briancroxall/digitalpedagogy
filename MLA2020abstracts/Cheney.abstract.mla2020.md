##(Against) the Syllabus as Instrument of Abuse
###Matthew Cheney, Plymouth State University

Responding to a recent report of a syllabus on which a professor said he would accept no excuses whatsoever for missing exams, Jesse Stommel said, "I wish it went without saying that syllabi should not be instruments of abuse."
 
Often, the policies and procedures on syllabi are written like edicts from a Grand High Executioner. Where does this desire to scare students come from? What does it say about our philosophy of teaching when we begin a course with Thou shalt not…?
 
When I started teaching at the college level, my own syllabi were authoritarian statements, despite my personal anti-authoritarian inclinations. This happened because of an idea of the College Professor that I had internalized, an idea powerful enough to lead me to think that my job as a college teacher, and thus as a writer of a college syllabus, was to assert my authority through numerous demands and threats of penalty.
 
Through recognizing that my syllabus was at odds both with my philosophy and practice, I began to make changes. Learning about and discussing the principles of Open Pedagogy with colleagues led me to reconfigure the structure and purpose of my syllabi. Because of institutional requirements, a syllabus will always be a compromise, but it does not need to be authoritarian and abusive. If we assume that our students are human beings, that our job is to build knowledge and conversations with them, and that every one of our students ought to feel welcome in our classroom, then the syllabus can stop being an instrument of abuse and become an instrument of engagement and even, perhaps, liberation — liberation for us as teachers at least as much as for students.
