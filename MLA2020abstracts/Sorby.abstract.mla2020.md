##The Syllabus As Handwork
###Angela Sorby, Marquette University

In *Syllabus: Notes from an Accidental Professor* (2014) Lynda Barry radically re-imagines "the syllabus" as a fanciful, hand-lettered and illustrated document akin to a graphic memoir.  Barry's book reproduces multiple syllabi from her UW-Madison courses, conveying ordinary information (office hours, assignments) using extraordinary handwork:  watercolor monsters, stick-figure dialogues, a recurring squid, snatches of re-copied Emily Dickinson poems, and personal asides. As a professor of both literature and creative writing,I am especially intrigued by Barry's use of hand-lettering and hand-drawing in lieu of digital media. This is not just retro; rather, it suggests that some forms of learning are embodied, one-of-a-kind, and even a little messy. Classroom documents that incorporate an autobiographical voice, hand-lettering, visible revisions, and even amateur drawings can, perhaps, spur the co-creation of a classroom space that discourages perfectionism while celebrating the productive art of play.  At the same time, perils emerge: do "creative" syllabi encourage student creativity, or simply showcase the instructor?  Can handmade syllabi be flexible, inclusive, and interactive in ways that complement, without replicating, digital texts?
